VFL - Vocal For Local is an app designed specifically for individuals in India who lack a recognized name or brand in the market. This app aims to assist such people by providing a platform to sell their products to a wider audience and connect with potential customers. The app offers features such as the ability to add products for sale, a delivery status indicator (including options like Completed, In Order, and Pending), and the ability to filter orders based on their status.

Moreover, the app includes a direct call feature, enabling users to communicate directly with sellers and negotiate pricing using contact numbers. It also incorporates a GPS Map System for tracking order delivery status. Notification options are available to alert users when they receive messages. The app utilizes fragments, including options for adding products for sale and displaying a list of already added items. The home fragment showcases a list of available products, while the third fragment displays saved products added to the bucket list.

In the top right corner, a search bar allows users to search for specific products. Additionally, a navigation bar maintains the user's profile, providing access to previous orders.
